## ðŸŽ¯ Leitner System Logic
- **Flashcards start at Level 0**.
- **If answered correctly**, they move to the next level (up to Level 4).
- **If answered incorrectly**, they go back to Level 0.
- **Higher levels have longer review intervals**:
  - **Level 0 â†’ 1 day**
  - **Level 1 â†’ 2 days**
  - **Level 2 â†’ 4 days**
  - **Level 3 â†’ 7 days**
  - **Level 4 â†’ 14 days**
- Flashcards are fetched **based on their next review date**.
